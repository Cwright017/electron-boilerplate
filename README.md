# Electron-Boilerplate
Simple boilerplate for [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) projects complete with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/) and [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel).

## Getting Started

### - Installing
* Clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/Cwright017/electron-boilerplate`

* Install dependencies: `cd electron-boilerplate && npm install`

### - Running
* Simply run `npm start` :tada:

and there you have it, a running Electron app. ðŸ˜†

You will notice that the app includes the Chrome dev tools when ran in development mode - to stop showing these just change the `NODE_ENV` to anything but dev in the `package.json`.

## Development

The main app entry point is `main.js` and this sits in the root of the project. Main.js is the [main process](http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/) of the electron app, and here you control the 'native' aspects of the application, such as menu bars, showing/hiding and hotkeys.

The entry point into the [render process](http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/) is `index.jsx`, located inside the `app` folder along with all other render process items. The render process is basically just a regular web app with access to regular Chrome apis with the addition of being able to access Electron specific apis.

### - [React-Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router)
The `index.jsx` file is the file listing the routes to be used by [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router).

### - [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
The render process part of the app is built using Facebook's [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) view library, for a componentized structure.

To develop components simply create a folder under `app/components` with the name of your component and include:
 ```
import {render} from 'react-dom';
import React from 'react';
 ```

in your component. Then you can write a regular es6 class extending `React.component`

### - ES6
The app includes [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) in the form of [Babel-Loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) allowing you to write your components in ES6 and JSX and this will be transpiled into browser compatible ES5.

### - [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
The app is configured to use css modules by default allowing each component to include its own stylesheet without classes conflicting with other components, making for easy sharable components.

Simply import the stylesheet like a regular js module and then reference the class you want in the jsx:

 ```
 import {render} from 'react-dom';
 import React from 'react';
 import style from './app.scss';

 export default class App extends React.Component {

   render () {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1 className={style.title}> Hello World </h1>
       </div>
     )
   }
 }
 ```

css can be written using regular css syntax, or [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) thanks to the [sass-loader](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader).

## Testing
The project is setup to use the  [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) testing framework with [Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai) assertions allowing for easy unit testing. The project also includes AirBnB's [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) tool to make manipulating react components within tests easier.

To run the unit tests use the standard `npm test` and the mocha output will appear in your terminal after they have finished running.

Tests are located within each components folder as a `*.spec.js` file, and mocha is configured to automatically find these files.

## Packaging

To package the app once you have finished developing, just run `npm run package` and this will tell [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) to bundle your application into a `dist` folder in the root of the project - and then [Electron-Packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) will package your app using the name specified in the `Package.json` name field.

The project is setup to produce an app for Mac but this can be configured by passing in different arguments to Electron-Packager - and allows packaging of OS X, Windows and Linux apps, as well as signed apps for the Mac App Store.
